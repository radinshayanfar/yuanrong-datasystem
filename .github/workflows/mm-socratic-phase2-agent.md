# synthesizes from it. Needs actions:read to download that artifact. See

# MM Socratic Phase-2 Agent — synthesize the documentation set

Phase 2 ran in the setup steps: it restored the answered Question Tree from the
answering step, synthesized `docs/specs/*` + `docs/arc42/*`, and staged the leg's
final tree (tree files + docs + `MANIFEST.txt`) into `/tmp/gh-aw/out`, plus seeded
`/tmp/gh-aw/evidence.json`.

## Task context

Read `/tmp/gh-aw/task-context.json`:
- `pr`, `iteration`, `feedback`
- `inputs.tree`: phase-1 evidence `{run_id, files}`.
- `inputs.answers`: the answering step's evidence `{run_id, files}` — its `run_id`
  named the answered-tree artifact that was restored (the OPEN leaves are already
  filled in, automatically — there is no human gate).

## Your job — ensure a complete doc set

1. Verify the staged `OPEN_QUESTIONS-*.adoc` is answered (each leaf has an answer
   or a `(deferred)` marker, no `_(write here)_` blanks). Fill any gaps from the
   code/diff (cite `file:line`) or mark them deferred.
2. Confirm `/tmp/gh-aw/out` contains the full set the `socratic-docs-present`
   check requires: `docs/specs/prd-*.adoc`, `docs/specs/use-cases-*.adoc`, at
   least one `docs/specs/adrs/*.adoc`, and `docs/arc42/arc42-*.adoc`. Generate any
   that are missing, grounded in the tree + answers (cite `file:line` or mark
   `(team answer)`; never invent facts).
3. Refresh `MANIFEST.txt` (the sorted file list) and regenerate
   `/tmp/gh-aw/evidence.json` so `files[].path` matches `/tmp/gh-aw/out`,
   keeping `run_id` = `GITHUB_RUN_ID`.
4. Do NOT post comments or touch GitHub. The `combine` merge hook pulls the
   `mm-tree-socratic` artifact by `run_id` and pushes it under `socratic/`.
