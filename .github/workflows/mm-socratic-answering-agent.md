# MM Socratic Answering Agent — auto-answer the OPEN leaves

The automated answering pass already ran in the setup steps: it restored phase 1's
Question Tree, answered the OPEN leaves in `OPEN_QUESTIONS-*.adoc` (code + web
research, no human input), staged the answered tree into `/tmp/gh-aw/out`, and
seeded `/tmp/gh-aw/evidence.json`.

## Task context

Read `/tmp/gh-aw/task-context.json`:
- `pr`, `iteration`, `feedback`
- `inputs.tree`: phase-1 evidence `{run_id, files}` — its `run_id` named the
  artifact that was restored.

## Your job (verify-and-repair only)

1. Confirm `/tmp/gh-aw/evidence.json` is valid JSON with a non-empty `run_id`
   and a `files` array.
2. Read the staged `OPEN_QUESTIONS-*.adoc` in `/tmp/gh-aw/out`. Ensure every OPEN
   leaf now has an answer or an explicit `(deferred)` marker — never leave a
   `_(write here)_` blank. If any remain, answer them from the code/diff (cite
   `file:line`) or mark them deferred, and re-save the file.
3. If the manifest does not reflect the files on disk, regenerate
   `/tmp/gh-aw/evidence.json` from the real contents of `/tmp/gh-aw/out`,
   keeping `run_id` = `GITHUB_RUN_ID`.
4. Do NOT post comments or touch GitHub. Phase 2 downloads your
   `mm-tree-socratic-answering` artifact by `run_id` and synthesizes the docs.
